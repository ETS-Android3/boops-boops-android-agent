The cutest Drozer fork out there

![alt text](https://github.com/FSecureLabs/boops-boops-android-agent/blob/main/boopsboops-logo.jpeg)

This fork was created to accompany CVE-2022-22288 (link to write up coming soon). This version of Boops Boops has all of the same features as Drozer, with the exception that the Drozer server starts automatically after launching Boops Boops.

To use Boops Boops, I recommend the Boops Boops Docker Container:

* Source code: https://github.com/Yogehi/boops-boops-docker-container
* Pre-built container: https://hub.docker.com/r/yogehi/boopsboops_docker

The name Boops Boops was submitted by a shark loving anonymous donor who refuses to be named. 

Also, the package name for this application is "live.hatch.russa". Don't install this package if you already have "live.hactch.russa" installed.
